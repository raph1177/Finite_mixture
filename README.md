# Finite_mixture
Python and R codes for the simulations in the paper "Bias-reduced estimation of finite mixtures"

The file first_sim_exerc_EM.py is the Python file to perform the paper's first simulation exercise.
The file second_sim_exerc_CEM.py is the Python file to perform the paper's second simulation exercise.
The file graph_mixtures.R is the R file that produces all simulation graphs shown in the paper (with ggplot).
Additional files related to mixtures of binary choice models will be made available soon.
